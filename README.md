# Design and Development of an Autonomous Shopping AssistantChatbot for Retail Stores
<br>
This project focuses on the design and development of an autonomous voice-enabled shopping assistant
chatbot for retail stores, aiming to enhance the in-store experience through hands-free interaction. Using speech
recognition and synthesis technologies, the system enables customers to search for products, obtain location
guidance, and dynamically estimate their billâ€”all through simple voice commands. The chatbot is built on the Python
Flask web framework and operates via a browser, eliminating the need for platform-specific apps. The backend
communicates with a database containing product information such as name, price, and location, while the voice
processing module ensures a natural and intuitive interface. Additionally, the system integrates an ESP32
microcontroller connected to a 16x2 LCD display and buzzer to provide real-time hardware feedback, further aiding
users with visual or physical impairments.
